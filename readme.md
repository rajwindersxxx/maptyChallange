## mapty project 
This project demonstrates my current JavaScript skills. The core functionality was developed by my Udemy instructor, Jonas, as part of the course. However, the challenges listed below were completed by me.
Tools Used: leaflet library
# Must-Do Challenges

- Delete All Workouts: Users can delete all workouts with a confirmation prompt.
- Edit workout: Users can modify workout distance , duration and time.
- Sort Workouts: Users can sort and filter workouts.
- Restore Workouts from Local Storage: Workouts are reconstructed from local storage on app reload.
- Error and Confirmation Messages: User-friendly messages are displayed for errors and confirmations.
- Map Zoom to Fit All Workouts: Automatically adjusts the map to display all logged workouts on screen.

## Other Challenges

- Geoder Locations: Converts workout coordinates into readable addresses using OpenCage, showing the location where the workout took place (e.g., "Run in Faro, Portugal").
- Weather Data: Fetches and displays real-time weather data for the specific time and location of the workout using openWeatherApi

## Technologies Used

- Leaflet.js for interactive maps and geolocation.
- JavaScript (ES6) with modern features such as classes and template literals.
- LocalStorage for saving and persisting workouts.
- APIs for geocoding (OpenCage) and real-time weather data (open metro weather ap).
